Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office. Can you help me find one?\"\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the input sentence can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful and engaging response.", "message": "_backward_through_llm gradient"}

To improve the input sentence, consider adding more details that can help the language model understand the user's preferences, such as:\n\n* The type of cuisine they're looking for (e.g., breakfast, dinner, burgers, etc.)\n* Any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)\n* The location or region they're in (to provide location-specific recommendations)\n\nFor example, you could rephrase the input sentence to:\n\n\"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location.\"\n\nBy adding more context, you can help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response that meets the user's needs.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider adding more specificity to the input sentence to make it more engaging and interesting. For instance:\n\n\"I'm in the mood for a classic Grand Slam at Denny's, but I'm not sure if they have it on the menu today.\"\n\nBy adding more specificity, you can help the language model generate a response that's more relevant and engaging, while also providing a more accurate answer to the user's question.\n\nOverall, the key is to provide enough context and specificity to help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response, while also making the input sentence more engaging and interesting.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location. </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDenny's is a great place for a hearty breakfast.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office. Can you help me find one?\"\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the input sentence can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful and engaging response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The input sentence) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office. Can you help me find one?\"\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the input sentence can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful and engaging response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The input sentence) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

To improve this, I'd suggest adding a specific location-related detail to the sentence. Here are a few options:\n\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, which is just a block away from my current location, [insert nearby landmark or address].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, just a short walk from [insert nearby park or public transportation hub].\"\n\nBy adding a specific location-related detail, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to better understand the user's current location, which can improve the accuracy of the response.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too casual and conversational. To improve this, I'd suggest using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions like \"totally craving\". Here's an example:\n\n\"Hello, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n\nBy using a more formal tone, the input sentence becomes more polished and professional, which can improve the overall quality of the response.\n\nFinally, I'd suggest considering adding more specific details about the user's preferences, such as their dietary restrictions or allergies. For example:\n\n\"Hey, I'm looking for a restaurant near my office that serves gluten-free pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon. Can you recommend a Denny's location that meets these requirements?\"\n\nBy providing more specific details, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to generate a more accurate and relevant response.\n\nOverall, the key to improving the input sentence is to provide more specific details about the user's location and preferences, while also using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location. </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDenny's is a great place for a hearty breakfast. Can you please tell me your current location so I can help you find the nearest Denny's? </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office. Can you help me find one?\"\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the input sentence can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful and engaging response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The input sentence) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office. Can you help me find one?\"\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the input sentence can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful and engaging response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

To improve the input sentence, consider adding more details that can help the language model understand the user's preferences, such as:\n\n* The type of cuisine they're looking for (e.g., breakfast, dinner, burgers, etc.)\n* Any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)\n* The location or region they're in (to provide location-specific recommendations)\n\nFor example, you could rephrase the input sentence to:\n\n\"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location.\"\n\nBy adding more context, you can help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response that meets the user's needs.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider adding more specificity to the input sentence to make it more engaging and interesting. For instance:\n\n\"I'm in the mood for a classic Grand Slam at Denny's, but I'm not sure if they have it on the menu today.\"\n\nBy adding more specificity, you can help the language model generate a response that's more relevant and engaging, while also providing a more accurate answer to the user's question.\n\nOverall, the key is to provide enough context and specificity to help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response, while also making the input sentence more engaging and interesting.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at 123 Main St, Anytown, USA.

Visit Denny's website: Go to dennys.com and use their restaurant locator tool. Enter your zip code or city and state (Anytown, USA) to find the nearest Denny's locations.\n2. Filter by gluten-free options: Once you have the list of nearby Denny's, you can filter the results by selecting \"Gluten-Free\" under the \"Filter\" or \"Dietary Restrictions\" option.\n3. Check the menu: Once you find a Denny's that serves gluten-free options, check their website or call the restaurant to confirm their gluten-free menu items, including their pancakes and bacon.\n\nIf you'd like, I can also suggest some alternative restaurants near your office that serve fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and crispy bacon.

However, the sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide enough context or specificity to help the language model understand the user's needs.\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Add more context**: Consider adding more details about the user's preferences, such as \"I'm looking for a Denny's location that serves gluten-free pancakes and bacon near my office at 123 Main St, Anytown, USA\" to help the language model understand the user's specific requirements.\n2. **Use more specific language**: Instead of using the phrase \"gluten-free options,\" consider using more specific language, such as \"I'm looking for a Denny's location that serves gluten-free pancakes and bacon\" to make it clear what the user is looking for.\n3. **Avoid ambiguity**: The sentence \"Can you recommend a Denny's location\" is quite open-ended and may lead to multiple possible responses.

To improve this, I'd suggest adding a specific location-related detail to the sentence. Here are a few options:\n\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, which is just a block away from my current location, [insert nearby landmark or address].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, just a short walk from [insert nearby park or public transportation hub].\"\n\nBy adding a specific location-related detail, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to better understand the user's current location, which can improve the accuracy of the response.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too casual and conversational. To improve this, I'd suggest using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions like \"totally craving\". Here's an example:\n\n\"Hello, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n\nBy using a more formal tone, the input sentence becomes more polished and professional, which can improve the overall quality of the response.\n\nFinally, I'd suggest considering adding more specific details about the user's preferences, such as their dietary restrictions or allergies. For example:\n\n\"Hey, I'm looking for a restaurant near my office that serves gluten-free pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon.

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking.

To improve this, I'd suggest adding a specific location-related detail to the sentence. Here are a few options:\n\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, which is just a block away from my current location, [insert nearby landmark or address].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, just a short walk from [insert nearby park or public transportation hub].\"\n\nBy adding a specific location-related detail, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to better understand the user's current location, which can improve the accuracy of the response.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too casual and conversational. To improve this, I'd suggest using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions like \"totally craving\". Here's an example:\n\n\"Hello, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n\nBy using a more formal tone, the input sentence becomes more polished and professional, which can improve the overall quality of the response.\n\nFinally, I'd suggest considering adding more specific details about the user's preferences, such as their dietary restrictions or allergies. For example:\n\n\"Hey, I'm looking for a restaurant near my office that serves gluten-free pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon. Can you recommend a Denny's location that meets these requirements?\"\n\nBy providing more specific details, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to generate a more accurate and relevant response.\n\nOverall, the key to improving the input sentence is to provide more specific details about the user's location and preferences, while also using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location. </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDenny's is a great place for a hearty breakfast.

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

To improve the input sentence, consider adding more details that can help the language model understand the user's preferences, such as:\n\n* The type of cuisine they're looking for (e.g., breakfast, dinner, burgers, etc.)\n* Any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)\n* The location or region they're in (to provide location-specific recommendations)\n\nFor example, you could rephrase the input sentence to:\n\n\"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location.\"\n\nBy adding more context, you can help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response that meets the user's needs.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider adding more specificity to the input sentence to make it more engaging and interesting. For instance:\n\n\"I'm in the mood for a classic Grand Slam at Denny's, but I'm not sure if they have it on the menu today.\"\n\nBy adding more specificity, you can help the language model generate a response that's more relevant and engaging, while also providing a more accurate answer to the user's question.\n\nOverall, the key is to provide enough context and specificity to help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response, while also making the input sentence more engaging and interesting.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at 123 Main St, Anytown, USA.

To improve this, I'd suggest adding a specific location-related detail to the sentence. Here are a few options:\n\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, which is just a block away from my current location, [insert nearby landmark or address].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, just a short walk from [insert nearby park or public transportation hub].\"\n\nBy adding a specific location-related detail, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to better understand the user's current location, which can improve the accuracy of the response.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too casual and conversational. To improve this, I'd suggest using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions like \"totally craving\".

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office. Can you help me find one?\"\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the input sentence can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful and engaging response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nSince the language model's output is a generic response about Denny's, it suggests that the input sentence \"I love to go to dennys\" is not providing enough context or specificity to elicit a relevant and accurate response. To improve the input sentence, consider adding more details that can help the language model understand the user's preferences, such as:\n\n* The type of cuisine they're looking for (e.g., breakfast, dinner, burgers, etc.)\n* Any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)\n* The location or region they're in (to provide location-specific recommendations)\n\nFor example, you could rephrase the input sentence to:\n\n\"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location.\"\n\nBy adding more context, you can help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response that meets the user's needs.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider adding more specificity to the input sentence to make it more engaging and interesting. For instance:\n\n\"I'm in the mood for a classic Grand Slam at Denny's, but I'm not sure if they have it on the menu today.\"\n\nBy adding more specificity, you can help the language model generate a response that's more relevant and engaging, while also providing a more accurate answer to the user's question.\n\nOverall, the key is to provide enough context and specificity to help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response, while also making the input sentence more engaging and interesting.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at 123 Main St, Anytown, USA.

To improve this, I'd suggest adding a specific location-related detail to the sentence. Here are a few options:\n\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, which is just a block away from my current location, [insert nearby landmark or address].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, just a short walk from [insert nearby park or public transportation hub].\"\n\nBy adding a specific location-related detail, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to better understand the user's current location, which can improve the accuracy of the response.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too casual and conversational. To improve this, I'd suggest using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions like \"totally craving\". Here's an example:\n\n\"Hello, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n\nBy using a more formal tone, the input sentence becomes more polished and professional, which can improve the overall quality of the response.\n\nFinally, I'd suggest considering adding more specific details about the user's preferences, such as their dietary restrictions or allergies.

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The input sentence) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

To improve this, you could consider adding more specific information about the user's location, such as their city or zip code. This would allow the language model to provide more accurate and relevant results.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten to include more specific location information:\n\n<VARIABLE> Hey, I'm in need of a gluten-free breakfast spot near downtown San Francisco, CA that serves Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu. </VARIABLE>\n\nBy adding the city and state, the language model can better understand the user's location and provide more relevant results.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it is phrased as a question, which may not be the most effective way to ask for recommendations.

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface.

Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The input sentence) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The input sentence) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

To improve the input sentence, consider adding more details that can help the language model understand the user's preferences, such as:\n\n* The type of cuisine they're looking for (e.g., breakfast, dinner, burgers, etc.)\n* Any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)\n* The location or region they're in (to provide location-specific recommendations)\n\nFor example, you could rephrase the input sentence to:\n\n\"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location.\"\n\nBy adding more context, you can help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response that meets the user's needs.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider adding more specificity to the input sentence to make it more engaging and interesting. For instance:\n\n\"I'm in the mood for a classic Grand Slam at Denny's, but I'm not sure if they have it on the menu today.\"\n\nBy adding more specificity, you can help the language model generate a response that's more relevant and engaging, while also providing a more accurate answer to the user's question.\n\nOverall, the key is to provide enough context and specificity to help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response, while also making the input sentence more engaging and interesting.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at 123 Main St, Anytown, USA.

Visit Denny's website: Go to dennys.com and use their restaurant locator tool. Enter your zip code or city and state (Anytown, USA) to find the nearest Denny's locations.\n2.

Check the menu: Once you find a Denny's that serves gluten-free options, check their website or call the restaurant to confirm their gluten-free menu items, including their pancakes and bacon.\n\nIf you'd like, I can also suggest some alternative restaurants near your office that serve fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and crispy bacon.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

Consider rephrasing the sentence to be more direct and clear:\n\n<VARIABLE> I'm looking for a gluten-free breakfast spot near my office in downtown San Francisco, CA. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu? </VARIABLE>\n\nThis revised sentence is more direct and to the point, making it easier for the language model to understand the user's intent and provide a more accurate response.\n\nFinally, consider adding more specific details about the user's preferences, such as their dietary restrictions or any specific menu items they are interested in. This could help the language model provide more tailored recommendations:\n\n<VARIABLE> I'm looking for a gluten-free breakfast spot near my office in downtown San Francisco, CA that serves omelets and pancakes.

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

Visit Denny's website: You can visit Denny's website and use their restaurant locator tool to find a location near you.\n2. Check online review sites: Websites like Yelp or TripAdvisor can give you an idea of which Denny's locations have gluten-free options and are highly rated by customers.\n3.

Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The input sentence) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

To improve the variable, it's essential to make it more specific and clear, while also considering the context and constraints of the conversation.\n\nOne possible way to improve the variable is to use a more specific and clear phrase that is also relevant to the context of the conversation.

Visit Denny's website: Go to Denny's official website ([www.dennys.com](http://www.dennys.com)) and use their restaurant locator tool. You can enter your location or zip code to find a Denny's near you.\n2. Check online review sites: Websites like Yelp or TripAdvisor often have reviews and menus for specific Denny's locations.

To improve this, you could consider adding more specific information about the user's location, such as their city or zip code. This would allow the language model to provide more accurate and relevant results.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten to include more specific location information:\n\n<VARIABLE> Hey, I'm in need of a gluten-free breakfast spot near downtown San Francisco, CA that serves Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu. </VARIABLE>\n\nBy adding the city and state, the language model can better understand the user's location and provide more relevant results.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it is phrased as a question, which may not be the most effective way to ask for recommendations. Consider rephrasing the sentence to be more direct and clear:\n\n<VARIABLE> I'm looking for a gluten-free breakfast spot near my office in downtown San Francisco, CA. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu? </VARIABLE>\n\nThis revised sentence is more direct and to the point, making it easier for the language model to understand the user's intent and provide a more accurate response.\n\nFinally, consider adding more specific details about the user's preferences, such as their dietary restrictions or any specific menu items they are interested in. This could help the language model provide more tailored recommendations:\n\n<VARIABLE> I'm looking for a gluten-free breakfast spot near my office in downtown San Francisco, CA that serves omelets and pancakes. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu? </VARIABLE>\n\nBy providing more specific details, the language model can better understand the user's preferences and provide more relevant results.\n\nOverall, the key to improving the input sentence is to provide more specific information about the user's location and preferences, and to rephrase the sentence to be more direct and clear.", "message": "_backward_through_llm gradient"}

To improve the input sentence, consider adding more details that can help the language model understand the user's preferences, such as:\n\n* The type of cuisine they're looking for (e.g., breakfast, dinner, burgers, etc.)\n* Any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)\n* The location or region they're in (to provide location-specific recommendations)\n\nFor example, you could rephrase the input sentence to:\n\n\"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location.\"\n\nBy adding more context, you can help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response that meets the user's needs.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider adding more specificity to the input sentence to make it more engaging and interesting. For instance:\n\n\"I'm in the mood for a classic Grand Slam at Denny's, but I'm not sure if they have it on the menu today.\"\n\nBy adding more specificity, you can help the language model generate a response that's more relevant and engaging, while also providing a more accurate answer to the user's question.\n\nOverall, the key is to provide enough context and specificity to help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response, while also making the input sentence more engaging and interesting.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at 123 Main St, Anytown, USA.

Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

However, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to your current location. But I can guide you through a few options to find one:\n\n1. **Google Search**: You can simply type \"Denny's near me\" or \"Denny's near my location\" in Google, and it will show you the nearest locations along with their addresses, phone numbers, and directions.\n2. **Denny's Website**: You can visit Denny's official website ([www.dennys.com](http://www.dennys.com)) and use their restaurant locator tool. Enter your zip code or city and state, and it will show you the nearest Denny's locations.\n3. **Maps App**: You can also use your smartphone's maps app (e.g., Google Maps, Apple Maps) and search for \"Denny's\" in your area. It will show you the nearest locations along with their addresses and directions.\n\nIf you're just a block away from your office, you can try searching for \"Denny's near my office\" or \"Denny's near [your office address]\". This should give you the most accurate results.\n\nI hope this helps, and I hope you enjoy your fluffy pancakes and crispy bacon at Denny's! </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system.

To improve this, I'd suggest adding a specific location-related detail to the sentence. Here are a few options:\n\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, which is just a block away from my current location, [insert nearby landmark or address].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, just a short walk from [insert nearby park or public transportation hub].\"\n\nBy adding a specific location-related detail, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to better understand the user's current location, which can improve the accuracy of the response.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too casual and conversational.

Here's an example:\n\n\"Hello, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n\nBy using a more formal tone, the input sentence becomes more polished and professional, which can improve the overall quality of the response.\n\nFinally, I'd suggest considering adding more specific details about the user's preferences, such as their dietary restrictions or allergies. For example:\n\n\"Hey, I'm looking for a restaurant near my office that serves gluten-free pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

To improve the input sentence, consider adding more details that can help the language model understand the user's preferences, such as:\n\n* The type of cuisine they're looking for (e.g., breakfast, dinner, burgers, etc.)\n* Any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)\n* The location or region they're in (to provide location-specific recommendations)\n\nFor example, you could rephrase the input sentence to:\n\n\"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location.\"\n\nBy adding more context, you can help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response that meets the user's needs.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider adding more specificity to the input sentence to make it more engaging and interesting. For instance:\n\n\"I'm in the mood for a classic Grand Slam at Denny's, but I'm not sure if they have it on the menu today.\"\n\nBy adding more specificity, you can help the language model generate a response that's more relevant and engaging, while also providing a more accurate answer to the user's question.\n\nOverall, the key is to provide enough context and specificity to help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response, while also making the input sentence more engaging and interesting.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

Visit Denny's website: Go to Denny's official website ([www.dennys.com](http://www.dennys.com)) and use their restaurant locator tool.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office. Can you help me find one?\"\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the input sentence can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful and engaging response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

However, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to your current location. But I can guide you through a few options to find one:\n\n1. **Google Search**: You can simply type \"Denny's near me\" or \"Denny's near my location\" in Google, and it will show you the nearest locations along with their addresses, phone numbers, and directions.\n2. **Denny's Website**: You can visit Denny's official website ([www.dennys.com](http://www.dennys.com)) and use their restaurant locator tool. Enter your zip code or city and state, and it will show you the nearest Denny's locations.\n3. **Maps App**: You can also use your smartphone's maps app (e.g., Google Maps, Apple Maps) and search for \"Denny's\" in your area. It will show you the nearest locations along with their addresses and directions.\n\nIf you're just a block away from your office, you can try searching for \"Denny's near my office\" or \"Denny's near [your office address]\". This should give you the most accurate results.\n\nI hope this helps, and I hope you enjoy your fluffy pancakes and crispy bacon at Denny's! </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the evaluation output, I'd like to provide feedback on the input sentence to improve its effectiveness in achieving the objective function.\n\nOne potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too general and doesn't provide enough context about the user's current location. To improve this, I'd suggest adding a specific location-related detail to the sentence. Here are a few options:\n\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, which is just a block away from my current location, [insert nearby landmark or address].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, just a short walk from [insert nearby park or public transportation hub].\"\n\nBy adding a specific location-related detail, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to better understand the user's current location, which can improve the accuracy of the response.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too casual and conversational. To improve this, I'd suggest using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions like \"totally craving\".

Enter your zip code or city and state, and it will show you the nearest Denny's locations.\n3. **Maps App**: You can also use your smartphone's maps app (e.g., Google Maps, Apple Maps) and search for \"Denny's\" in your area.

To improve this, I'd suggest adding a specific location-related detail to the sentence. Here are a few options:\n\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, which is just a block away from my current location, [insert nearby landmark or address].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, just a short walk from [insert nearby park or public transportation hub].\"\n\nBy adding a specific location-related detail, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to better understand the user's current location, which can improve the accuracy of the response.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too casual and conversational. To improve this, I'd suggest using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions like \"totally craving\". Here's an example:\n\n\"Hello, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n\nBy using a more formal tone, the input sentence becomes more polished and professional, which can improve the overall quality of the response.\n\nFinally, I'd suggest considering adding more specific details about the user's preferences, such as their dietary restrictions or allergies.

However, I don't have your exact location. Could you please provide me with the nearby intersection or street name of your office? That way, I can give you a more accurate recommendation.\n\nAlso, I can suggest some general tips for finding a Denny's near you that serves gluten-free options:\n\n1. Visit Denny's website: You can visit Denny's website and use their restaurant locator tool to find a location near you.\n2. Check online review sites: Websites like Yelp or TripAdvisor can give you an idea of which Denny's locations have gluten-free options and are highly rated by customers.\n3. Call the Denny's directly: You can call the Denny's location near your office and ask about their gluten-free options and menu.\n\nOnce I have your location, I can give you a more specific recommendation. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the evaluation output, I'd like to provide feedback on the input sentence to improve the objective function.\n\nThe current input sentence is: \"Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name]. Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The input sentence) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

To improve the input sentence, consider adding more details that can help the language model understand the user's preferences, such as:\n\n* The type of cuisine they're looking for (e.g., breakfast, dinner, burgers, etc.)\n* Any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)\n* The location or region they're in (to provide location-specific recommendations)\n\nFor example, you could rephrase the input sentence to:\n\n\"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location.\"\n\nBy adding more context, you can help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response that meets the user's needs.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider adding more specificity to the input sentence to make it more engaging and interesting. For instance:\n\n\"I'm in the mood for a classic Grand Slam at Denny's, but I'm not sure if they have it on the menu today.\"\n\nBy adding more specificity, you can help the language model generate a response that's more relevant and engaging, while also providing a more accurate answer to the user's question.\n\nOverall, the key is to provide enough context and specificity to help the language model generate a more accurate and relevant response, while also making the input sentence more engaging and interesting.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].

For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative.

That way, I can give you a more accurate recommendation.\n\nAlso, I can suggest some general tips for finding a Denny's near you that serves gluten-free options:\n\n1. Visit Denny's website: You can visit Denny's website and use their restaurant locator tool to find a location near you.\n2. Check online review sites: Websites like Yelp or TripAdvisor can give you an idea of which Denny's locations have gluten-free options and are highly rated by customers.\n3. Call the Denny's directly: You can call the Denny's location near your office and ask about their gluten-free options and menu.\n\nOnce I have your location, I can give you a more specific recommendation. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the evaluation output, I'd like to provide feedback on the input sentence to improve the objective function.\n\nThe current input sentence is: \"Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name]. Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The input sentence) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

Visit Denny's website: You can visit Denny's website and use their restaurant locator tool to find a location near you.\n2.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the evaluation output, I'd like to provide feedback on the input sentence to improve the objective function.\n\nThe current input sentence is: \"Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name]. Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The input sentence) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

Visit Denny's website: Go to dennys.com and use their restaurant locator tool. Enter your zip code or city and state (Anytown, USA) to find the nearest Denny's locations.\n2. Filter by gluten-free options: Once you have the list of nearby Denny's, you can filter the results by selecting \"Gluten-Free\" under the \"Filter\" or \"Dietary Restrictions\" option.\n3. Check the menu: Once you find a Denny's that serves gluten-free options, check their website or call the restaurant to confirm their gluten-free menu items, including their pancakes and bacon.\n\nIf you'd like, I can also suggest some alternative restaurants near your office that serve fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and crispy bacon.

However, the sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide enough context or specificity to help the language model understand the user's needs.\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Add more context**: Consider adding more details about the user's preferences, such as \"I'm looking for a Denny's location that serves gluten-free pancakes and bacon near my office at 123 Main St, Anytown, USA\" to help the language model understand the user's specific requirements.\n2. **Use more specific language**: Instead of using the phrase \"gluten-free options,\" consider using more specific language, such as \"I'm looking for a Denny's location that serves gluten-free pancakes and bacon\" to make it clear what the user is looking for.\n3. **Avoid ambiguity**: The sentence \"Can you recommend a Denny's location\" is quite open-ended and may lead to multiple possible responses. Consider rephrasing it to \"Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options near my office\" to make it more specific and clear.\n4. **Use more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a somewhat formal tone, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Consider using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a restaurant rec near my office - can you suggest a Denny's that's got gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a restaurant rec near my office at 123 Main St, Anytown, USA - can you suggest a Denny's that serves gluten-free pancakes and bacon?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, clear, and conversational, which can help the language model better understand the user's needs and provide a more accurate response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].

For example:\n\n* \"Recommend a Denny's near my office with gluten-free options\"\n* \"Provide a list of nearby restaurants that serve breakfast\"\n* \"Suggest a breakfast spot with a separate gluten-free menu\"\n\nBy using more specific and clear language, the variable can provide more accurate and helpful responses, which can improve the overall user experience.", "message": "_backward_through_llm gradient"}

Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface.

Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu.

For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface.

Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking.

That way, I can give you a more accurate recommendation.\n\nAlso, I can suggest some general tips for finding a Denny's near you that serves gluten-free options:\n\n1. Visit Denny's website: You can visit Denny's website and use their restaurant locator tool to find a location near you.\n2. Check online review sites: Websites like Yelp or TripAdvisor can give you an idea of which Denny's locations have gluten-free options and are highly rated by customers.\n3. Call the Denny's directly: You can call the Denny's location near your office and ask about their gluten-free options and menu.\n\nOnce I have your location, I can give you a more specific recommendation. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the evaluation output, I'd like to provide feedback on the input sentence to improve the objective function.\n\nThe current input sentence is: \"Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name]. Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The input sentence) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu?\"\n\nBy making these changes, the input sentence becomes more specific, conversational, and direct, which can help the language model provide a more accurate and relevant response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office. Can you help me find one?\"\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the input sentence can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful and engaging response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at 123 Main St, Anytown, USA.

But I can guide you on how to find a Denny's near your office that serves gluten-free options.\n\nHere's what you can do:\n\n1. Visit Denny's website: Go to dennys.com and use their restaurant locator tool. Enter your zip code or city and state (Anytown, USA) to find the nearest Denny's locations.\n2. Filter by gluten-free options: Once you have the list of nearby Denny's, you can filter the results by selecting \"Gluten-Free\" under the \"Filter\" or \"Dietary Restrictions\" option.\n3. Check the menu: Once you find a Denny's that serves gluten-free options, check their website or call the restaurant to confirm their gluten-free menu items, including their pancakes and bacon.\n\nIf you'd like, I can also suggest some alternative restaurants near your office that serve fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and crispy bacon.

However, the sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide enough context or specificity to help the language model understand the user's needs.\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Add more context**: Consider adding more details about the user's preferences, such as \"I'm looking for a Denny's location that serves gluten-free pancakes and bacon near my office at 123 Main St, Anytown, USA\" to help the language model understand the user's specific requirements.\n2. **Use more specific language**: Instead of using the phrase \"gluten-free options,\" consider using more specific language, such as \"I'm looking for a Denny's location that serves gluten-free pancakes and bacon\" to make it clear what the user is looking for.\n3. **Avoid ambiguity**: The sentence \"Can you recommend a Denny's location\" is quite open-ended and may lead to multiple possible responses. Consider rephrasing it to \"Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options near my office\" to make it more specific and clear.\n4. **Use more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a somewhat formal tone, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface.

Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

To improve this, I'd suggest adding a specific location-related detail to the sentence. Here are a few options:\n\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, which is just a block away from my current location, [insert nearby landmark or address].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, just a short walk from [insert nearby park or public transportation hub].\"\n\nBy adding a specific location-related detail, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to better understand the user's current location, which can improve the accuracy of the response.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too casual and conversational.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office. Can you help me find one?\"\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the input sentence can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful and engaging response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at 123 Main St, Anytown, USA.

Visit Denny's website: Go to dennys.com and use their restaurant locator tool. Enter your zip code or city and state (Anytown, USA) to find the nearest Denny's locations.\n2. Filter by gluten-free options: Once you have the list of nearby Denny's, you can filter the results by selecting \"Gluten-Free\" under the \"Filter\" or \"Dietary Restrictions\" option.\n3. Check the menu: Once you find a Denny's that serves gluten-free options, check their website or call the restaurant to confirm their gluten-free menu items, including their pancakes and bacon.\n\nIf you'd like, I can also suggest some alternative restaurants near your office that serve fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and crispy bacon.

However, the sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide enough context or specificity to help the language model understand the user's needs.\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Add more context**: Consider adding more details about the user's preferences, such as \"I'm looking for a Denny's location that serves gluten-free pancakes and bacon near my office at 123 Main St, Anytown, USA\" to help the language model understand the user's specific requirements.\n2. **Use more specific language**: Instead of using the phrase \"gluten-free options,\" consider using more specific language, such as \"I'm looking for a Denny's location that serves gluten-free pancakes and bacon\" to make it clear what the user is looking for.\n3. **Avoid ambiguity**: The sentence \"Can you recommend a Denny's location\" is quite open-ended and may lead to multiple possible responses. Consider rephrasing it to \"Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options near my office\" to make it more specific and clear.\n4. **Use more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a somewhat formal tone, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface.

To improve the variable, it's essential to make it more specific and clear, while also considering the context and constraints of the conversation.\n\nOne possible way to improve the variable is to use a more specific and clear phrase that is also relevant to the context of the conversation.

Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the input sentence:\n\n1. **Make the request more specific**: The current sentence is quite general. Consider adding more details about the type of gluten-free options you're looking for (e.g., \"I'm looking for a Denny's with a separate gluten-free menu\" or \"I need a Denny's that offers gluten-free pancakes\").\n2. **Provide more context**: The sentence assumes that the user is familiar with Denny's and their menu. Consider adding a brief introduction to establish context, such as \"I'm looking for a breakfast spot near my office\" or \"I'm in the mood for a classic American breakfast.\"\n3. **Use more conversational language**: The sentence is a bit formal. Consider using more conversational language to make the request sound more natural, such as \"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options. Can you recommend a Denny's?\"\n4. **Avoid unnecessary words**: The sentence contains some unnecessary words, such as \"mouth-watering\" and \"fluffy.\" While these words might be descriptive, they don't add much value to the request. Consider removing them to make the sentence more concise.\n5. **Use a more direct question**: The sentence is phrased as a question, but it's not entirely clear what the user is asking. Consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more direct, such as \"Can you recommend a Denny's near my office that serves gluten-free options?\"\n\nHere's an example of an improved input sentence:\n\n\"Hey, I'm in need of a breakfast spot near my office that serves gluten-free options.

To improve this, I'd suggest adding a specific location-related detail to the sentence. Here are a few options:\n\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, which is just a block away from my current location, [insert nearby landmark or address].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, just a short walk from [insert nearby park or public transportation hub].\"\n\nBy adding a specific location-related detail, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to better understand the user's current location, which can improve the accuracy of the response.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too casual and conversational.

To improve this, you could consider adding more specific information about the user's location, such as their city or zip code.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

Consider rephrasing it to \"Can you recommend a Denny's location that serves gluten-free options near my office\" to make it more specific and clear.\n4. **Use more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a somewhat formal tone, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface.

Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

For instance:\n\n<VARIABLE> What's the best breakfast spot near me in New York City? </VARIABLE>\n\nThis would help the language model to provide a response that is tailored to the user's specific location, such as \"There are many great breakfast spots in New York City, but some popular options include Sarabeth's and Russ & Daughters Cafe.\"\n\nOverall, adding more context and specificity to the prompt can help the language model provide more accurate and relevant responses, which can improve the overall user experience.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that the current prompt is quite short and to the point, which can make it difficult for the language model to understand the user's intent. Consider adding a few more words or phrases to make the prompt more conversational and engaging, such as:\n\n<VARIABLE> Hey, I'm craving a hearty breakfast at a diner near my current location. Can you recommend some great options? </VARIABLE>\n\nThis can help the language model to better understand the user's intent and provide a more personalized response.", "message": "_backward_through_llm gradient"}

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office.

To improve this, I'd suggest adding a specific location-related detail to the sentence. Here are a few options:\n\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, which is just a block away from my current location, [insert nearby landmark or address].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, just a short walk from [insert nearby park or public transportation hub].\"\n\nBy adding a specific location-related detail, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to better understand the user's current location, which can improve the accuracy of the response.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too casual and conversational. To improve this, I'd suggest using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions like \"totally craving\". Here's an example:\n\n\"Hello, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n\nBy using a more formal tone, the input sentence becomes more polished and professional, which can improve the overall quality of the response.\n\nFinally, I'd suggest considering adding more specific details about the user's preferences, such as their dietary restrictions or allergies. For example:\n\n\"Hey, I'm looking for a restaurant near my office that serves gluten-free pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon. Can you recommend a Denny's location that meets these requirements?\"\n\nBy providing more specific details, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to generate a more accurate and relevant response.\n\nOverall, the key to improving the input sentence is to provide more specific details about the user's location and preferences, while also using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location. </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDenny's is a great place for a hearty breakfast. Can you please tell me your current location so I can help you find the nearest Denny's? </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office. Can you help me find one?\"\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the input sentence can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful and engaging response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The input sentence) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

For example:\n\n\"Hey, I'm looking for a restaurant near my office that serves gluten-free pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon. Can you recommend a Denny's location that meets these requirements?\"\n\nBy providing more specific details, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to generate a more accurate and relevant response.\n\nOverall, the key to improving the input sentence is to provide more specific details about the user's location and preferences, while also using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location. </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDenny's is a great place for a hearty breakfast. Can you please tell me your current location so I can help you find the nearest Denny's? </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe input sentence \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location\" is a good starting point, but it can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful response. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Add more context**: The sentence is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details about the user's preferences or location. Adding more context, such as the user's dietary restrictions or the type of breakfast they're in the mood for, could help the language model provide a more tailored response. For example, \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, and I'm looking for something with eggs and bacon.\"\n\n2. **Use more descriptive language**: The sentence is written in a very straightforward and simple style, which may not be engaging or informative. Using more descriptive language, such as \"I'm craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location,\" could make the sentence more appealing and help the language model understand the user's preferences.\n\n3. **Provide more specific location information**: The sentence mentions \"near my current location,\" but it's not clear what that means. Providing more specific location information, such as \"I'm craving a hearty breakfast at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office,\" could help the language model provide a more accurate and helpful response.\n\n4. **Use a more conversational tone**: The sentence is written in a very formal and direct style, which may not be suitable for a conversational interface. Using a more conversational tone, such as \"Hey, I'm totally craving a breakfast burrito at Denny's near my current location - can you help me find one?\" could make the sentence more engaging and friendly.\n\nHere's an example of how the input sentence could be rewritten with these suggestions in mind:\n\n\"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office. Can you help me find one?\"\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the input sentence can be improved to better align with the objective of providing a helpful and engaging response.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> Say applebees </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\n\n<LM_INPUT> Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my current location, which is just a block away from my office. Can you help me find one? </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'd be happy to help you find a Denny's near your location. However, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to your current location. But I can guide you through a few options to find one:\n\n1. **Google Search**: You can simply type \"Denny's near me\" or \"Denny's near my location\" in Google, and it will show you the nearest locations along with their addresses, phone numbers, and directions.\n2. **Denny's Website**: You can visit Denny's official website ([www.dennys.com](http://www.dennys.com)) and use their restaurant locator tool. Enter your zip code or city and state, and it will show you the nearest Denny's locations.\n3. **Maps App**: You can also use your smartphone's maps app (e.g., Google Maps, Apple Maps) and search for \"Denny's\" in your area. It will show you the nearest locations along with their addresses and directions.\n\nIf you're just a block away from your office, you can try searching for \"Denny's near my office\" or \"Denny's near [your office address]\". This should give you the most accurate results.\n\nI hope this helps, and I hope you enjoy your fluffy pancakes and crispy bacon at Denny's! </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The input sentence in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the evaluation output, I'd like to provide feedback on the input sentence to improve its effectiveness in achieving the objective function.\n\nOne potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too general and doesn't provide enough context about the user's current location. To improve this, I'd suggest adding a specific location-related detail to the sentence. Here are a few options:\n\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, which is just a block away from my current location, [insert nearby landmark or address].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n* \"Hey, I'm totally craving a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon at Denny's near my office, just a short walk from [insert nearby park or public transportation hub].\"\n\nBy adding a specific location-related detail, the input sentence becomes more informative and helps the language model to better understand the user's current location, which can improve the accuracy of the response.\n\nAnother potential issue with the current input sentence is that it's a bit too casual and conversational. To improve this, I'd suggest using a more formal tone and avoiding colloquial expressions like \"totally craving\". Here's an example:\n\n\"Hello, I am in need of a restaurant recommendation for a mouth-watering, fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit and a side of crispy bacon near my office, which is located at [insert nearby intersection or street name].\"\n\nBy using a more formal tone, the input sentence becomes more polished and professional, which can improve the overall quality of the response.\n\nFinally, I'd suggest considering adding more specific details about the user's preferences, such as their dietary restrictions or allergies.
