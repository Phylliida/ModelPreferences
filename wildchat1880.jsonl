It generates a low initial thrust. In space travel, this isn’t a problem.

The most effective treatment for all types is surgical repair, which can be carried out through open or laparoscopic surgery. The most common method for repairing inguinal hernias with prosthetic meshes is the Lichtenstein repair method. Open mesh methods had a lower recurrence rate than Shouldice methods and other non-mesh methods, according to a Cochrane review. Moreover, due to its established success, efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness, the Lichtenstein repair remains a popular option for both surgeons and patients”.","type":"translation","topic":"medicine_fitness","q_metadata":{},"makes_sense":true,"is_english":true}

Besides, this type of house-in-law problem was a Bengali's own domestic problem, and the strife-weary family of the matriarch was not at all lacking in the Bengali country once upon a time. Therefore, Dinabandhu did not have to go to Shakespeare for the dialogue or mood creation of this play.
