In the present section it occurs again in connexion with (1) the creation of living organisms (Genesis 1:21); (2) the creation of man (Genesis 1:27); (3) the creation of the whole universe (Genesis 2:3-4).

A different word, “made” (ʿasah), is used in connexion with the “vaulted dome” (Genesis 1:7), the heavenly bodies (Genesis 1:16), the terrestrial animals (Genesis 1:25).

Susan can potentially regain more mobility and get rid of her stomas, but all of this progress will require surgeries, and Susan is not sure she is ready for that yet.","type":"creative","topic":"personal_assistance"}

I already arranged with August to come in next Monday from 16:00 (08-07) but we didn't agree on any further scheduling. Since I would like to inform my country club's manager as early as possible, I want to know on what other days you would like to have me come in next week? Because I'll have a full day off on the upcoming Monday, I could only arrange for two more full days off (Saturday & Sunday for example) or I could try to ask for more free evenings and I could show up from 18:00 - 20:00.

It is not said to have been created. “Light,” not “darkness,” has its origin from God in the Creation account. However, Isaiah 45:7 describes God as the one who created darkness. God also inhabits darkness (Exod 20:21; Pss 18:9; 97:2). Throughout the Bible darkness symbolizes immorality or calamity, such as death (Ps 88:12), oppression (Isa 42:7), the wicked (Prov 2:13) and in general, sin.

To simplify the calculations, the signal spectrum is first calculated with the carrier frequency equal to zero, and then shifted to a given frequency. After all signal spectra have been generated and shifted to their corresponding carrier frequency, a white Gaussian noise of a given signal-to-noise ratio is added to the entire frequency range.

To translate “became,” or “came into being,” in order to import into the verse an allusion to the nebular hypothesis for the origin of the “solar system,” is an expedient not to be entertained by any scholarly interpreter. It is sufficient to remind the reader that the ancients were entirely ignorant of the Copernican theory of the solar system; and, ex hypothesi, could not have known Laplace’s nebular theory. It violates every canon of interpretation to assume that simple words, like “earth,” “darkness,” “water,” &c., were intended to convey to the Israelite reader not the meanings which the Hebrew equivalents everywhere else conveyed, but those which could only be understood after the scientific theories of the nineteenth century had transformed men’s conception of the universe.","type":"rewriting","topic":"literature"}

At the core of our method is an efficient robust monocular-based plane detection algorithm which does not require additional sensing modalities such as a stereo, depth camera or neural network. The project is built on top of OpenVINS and thus shares similar tooling and architecture. This plane detection and tracking algorithm enables real-time regularization of point features to environmental planes which are either maintained in the state vector as long-lived planes, or marginalized for efficiency. Planar regularities are applied to both in-state SLAM and out-of-state MSCKF point features, enabling long-term point-to-plane loop-closures due to the large spacial volume of planes.","type":"translation","topic":"technology_other"}

Several clinical studies in recent years addressed this issue and showed a correlation in hypothyroidism between high serum cholesterol and high TSH levels, the latter being usually used as an indication of the severity of the hypothyroidism. however, it was impossible to delineate a direct role of TSH as abnormal TH level (usually deficiency) was usually a coexisting factor.

In the present section it occurs again in connexion with (1) the creation of living organisms (Genesis 1:21); (2) the creation of man (Genesis 1:27); (3) the creation of the whole universe (Genesis 2:3-4).

It is, however, a mistake to suppose that the word bara’ necessarily means “to create out of nothing”; it often stresses forming anew, reforming, renewing (see Ps 51:10; Isa 43:15; 65:17).","type":"rewriting","topic":"literature"}

The displacement of an electron in the atom by a distance x induces a dipole equal to −ex. The displacements have their own natural angular frequency ω0, which is presumed to correspond to the transition frequency. The electric field of the light applies a force to the dipoles, and induces oscillations at its own frequency. The equation of motion for the displacement x of the electron is thus: me d2x dt2 + meγ dx dt + meω2 0x = F0 cos ωt, where me is the electron mass, γ is a damping constant, and F0 is the amplitude of the force applied to the electron by the light.

The name is probably to be related to the cult of Hermanubis attested by a third-century dedication in Thessalonike (across the Thermaic golf from Dion), which was set up by a cultic association of Hermanubis on behalf of certain individuals. This document and the personal name, along with a statue of the god from the Sarapeum of Carthage (LIMC n. 15), suggest that the cult of Hermanubis enjoyed some popularity outside its original home in the Roman period.[23]","type":"summarization","topic":"history"}

The account ends with the description of God’s rest on the seventh day in 2:1–3. The six-day structure reflects the overall pattern the writer gives to God’s work. Creation is organized into three categories: the heavens, the sea and sky, and the earth. God’s creative activity forms and then fills each of these categories.

The creation account emphasizes God’s power as He brings all things into existence through divine decree. God’s creative activity occurs over six days in Gen 1:3–31. The account ends with the description of ’Elohim’s rest on the seventh day in 2:1–3. Creation is organized into three categories: the heavens, the sea and sky, and the earth. ’Elohim’s creative activity forms and then fills each of these categories. The focus of the creation account demonstrates how ’Elohim brought order and structure to the universe. Throughout the Bible, ’Elohim’s power over creation shows His sovereignty (see Ps 104:1–35 and Isa 40:12).","type":"rewriting","topic":"literature"}

He also wears immobilizing hand braces, nasal cannula for respiratory support and special adult diapers and external condom catheter with attached urine bag due to incontinence. Reza has posted a photo, showing him in his huge cast being transferred from bed to wheelchair by hoist lift, as nurses operate it and secure Reza's tubes.

Throughout the Bible, God’s power over creation shows His sovereignty (see Ps 104:1–35; Isa 40:12).","type":"rewriting","topic":"literature"}

Creation is organized into three categories: the heavens, the sea and sky, and the earth. God’s creative activity forms and then fills each of these categories.

Are there any links where I could see the detailed billing of the semester?\nAlso, there is a link in my profile where I can apply for a scholarship for 2024. Is this for deferring my scholarships to 2024?\nI also attached some screenshots of the billing and scholarship tab from my profile.\nIf none of the scholarships were applied for this semester and only 3,729 $ is remaining, can I choose to cover that with the amount that will be paid for the TA position?","type":"rewriting","topic":"personal_assistance"}

The plot of the novel follows Pizzelle in her realization that her overabundance of accumulated doughnuts presents a problem: she has nobody to give her extra supply away to, and if they aren't eaten soon, they'll spoil. But she also doesn't want to throw away so many perfectly fine doughnuts, so she resorts to a third option; eating all of them herself, becoming absurdly and attractively overweight in doing so.","type":"creative","topic":"literature"}

The name is probably to be related to the cult of Hermanubis attested by a third-century dedication in Thessalonike (across the Thermaic golf from Dion), which was set up by a cultic association of Hermanubis on behalf of certain individuals. This document and the personal name, along with a statue of the god from the Sarapeum of Carthage (LIMC n. 15), suggest that the cult of Hermanubis enjoyed some popularity outside its original home in the Roman period.[23]","type":"summarization","topic":"history"}

On September 15, the marines captured the port. The soldiers then came ashore. General MacArthur personally directed the amphibious landing. It required especially careful planning because the tides at Incheon vary more than 30 feet (9 meters). Each boat had to land at high tide because any boat near the shore when the tide dropped would be trapped in mud. The troops who landed at Incheon cut off the North Koreans in the Busan Perimeter area from those north of Incheon.\"","type":"rewriting","topic":"history"}

As we discussed in our last meeting, shouldn't the sales ops role bridge between the Advertiser and Publisher departments? What are your thoughts on that?\n\nAnd speaking of the \"fun things\", can we talk about the financial aspects of the position? I'm curious to learn more about the compensation structure, bonus potential, company benefits, etc.\n\nAppreciate your time and the details. Looking forward!\n\nBest,\nSébastien","type":"rewriting","topic":"personal_assistance"}
