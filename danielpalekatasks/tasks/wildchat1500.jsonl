When you use a contrasting color the boundary stands out and adds a touch of creativity to the overall design.\n\nThis stitch is great when you are quilting and wanting to do some appliques or just adding another element to your embroidery project. The basis for this stitch style is the straight stitch and you just add a perpendicular stitch to the pattern to create the blanket stitch.\n\nIt is an easy pattern to do by hand but many different sewing machine models offer this stitch in its built-in set of stitch patterns.
